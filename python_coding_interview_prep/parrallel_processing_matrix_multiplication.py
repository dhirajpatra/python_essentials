"""
Here's a Python function for parallel matrix multiplication using the `multiprocessing` library:
Explanation:

1. `check_dims` function: This function verifies if the two matrices have compatible dimensions for multiplication (number of columns in the first matrix must equal number of rows in the second matrix).
2. `mat_mult` function: This function calculates the element at a specific row (`i`) and column (`j`) of the resulting matrix. It iterates through the corresponding elements in both matrices and performs the dot product. The result is stored in a shared memory array.
3. `parallel_mat_mult` function: This is the main function that performs parallel matrix multiplication. It first checks for compatible dimensions. Then, it creates a shared memory array using NumPy (`np.zeros`) to store the resulting matrix. It uses a `Pool` from the `multiprocessing` library to create multiple worker processes. Each process calls the `mat_mult` function with a different row index (`i`) to calculate the corresponding row of the resulting matrix. Finally, the function gathers the results from all processes and returns the complete resulting matrix.

Note:

* This example uses a simple loop for the inner multiplication. You might achieve better performance with optimized libraries like NumPy, which offer vectorized operations.
*  Make sure to replace `num_processes` with the desired number of processes to utilize for parallelization.
