Rahul is playing a game, wherein he has multiple coloured wooden blocks, stacked one above the other, 
his task is to remove all the wooden blocks from the stack, without letting it fall and in the 
minimum number of steps. He can remove one block of a colour at a time, 
but he can remove multiple blocks of the same colour together. 
Determine the minimum number of steps in which he can perform this task.

For example, if you remove [red,red] from (white,red,red,white), the resulting array is [white,white].

Note- there are only two colour blocks â€“ red and white

Function description :

0<=a[i]<=1

Sample input 1 :

4
red
white
white
red

Sample Output 2 :

2

Explanation :
