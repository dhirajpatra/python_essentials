Problem: Efficient Janitor

Problem Description:

A janitor has to move a list of weights, with each weight being a positive real number. 
However, the janitor can only carry up to 3.0 units of weight at a time. 
To minimize the number of trips, the janitor wants to carry as many weights as possible 
in each trip without exceeding the weight limit.

Write a function `efficient_janitor(weights)` that takes a list of weights as input and returns the minimum number of trips 
the janitor needs to make.

nput Format:

- The input consists of a single line containing a space-separated list of weights, 
where each weight (w) is a positive real number (0 < w â‰¤ 3.0).
- The length of the list of weights (n) is at most 10^5.

Output Format:

- Print a single integer representing the minimum number of trips the janitor needs to make.

Sample Input:

```
1.01 1.99 2.5 1.5 1.01
```

Sample Output:

```
2
```

Explanation:

The janitor can make two trips:

1. Trip 1: Carrying weights 1.01, 1.99, and 1.5 (total = 4.5).
2. Trip 2: Carrying weights 2.5 and 1.01 (total = 3.51).

This is the minimum number of trips required.
